# Agent based modelling: Tragedy of the Commons
This model can be used to replicate the experiments done in the research paper "To Herd or not to Herd, an Agent-Based Decision Process".

The model can be run by simply executing 
```ipython server_TotC.py```

This will start a web server that can be used to access the visualisation of the model. Different input parameters can be adjusted in the web interface.
